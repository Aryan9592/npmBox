## What is prisma?

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an open source next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

    - Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
    - Prisma Migrate: Migration system
    - Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm i prisma
```

## Features
- Major Features
    - Thinking in objects instead of mapping relational data
    - Queries not classes to avoid complex model objects
    - Single source of truth for database and application models
    - Healthy constraints that prevent common pitfalls and anti-patterns
    - An abstraction that makes the right thing easy ("pit of success")
    - Type-safe database queries that can be validated at compile time
    - Less boilerplate so developers can focus on the important parts of their app
    - Auto-completion in code editors instead of needing to look up documentation
