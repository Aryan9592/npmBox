## What is mongoose ?

- Mongoose is a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install mongoose
```



## Features

- Mongoose is a Node.js-based Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
-  It is akin to an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) such as [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for traditional SQL databases.
- The problem that Mongoose aims to solve is allowing developers to enforce a specific schema at the application layer. 
- In addition to enforcing a schema, Mongoose also offers a variety of hooks, model validation, and other features aimed at making it easier to work with MongoDB.
