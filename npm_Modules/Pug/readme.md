# Pug

Pug, formerly known as Jade, is a high-performance, expressive template engine for Node.js and browsers. It simplifies the process of generating HTML markup by providing a concise and readable syntax. Pug is often used with web frameworks like Express.js in Node.js applications, but it can also be used independently or with other JavaScript environments.



## Installation

You can install Pug globally or locally in your Node.js project using npm or yarn. (install express before that)

```bash
  npm install  pug
```

You can run this example by starting your Node.js application:

```bash
  node app.js
```
